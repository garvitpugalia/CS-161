The program was run on the test cases provided to get the following results:

1) PAD(x)

PAD(0) = PAD(1) = PAD(2) = 1
PAD(3) = 2
PAD(4) = 2
PAD(5) = 3
PAD(6) = 4
PAD(7) = 5
PAD(8) = 7
PAD(9) = 9
PAD(10) = 12

As values of x get higher, the function takes a lot more time due to the recursive element. For every recursive call, a new stack is allocated (since the function isn't tail recursive) which also takes up a lot of memory and time.

2) SUMS(x)

SUMS(0) = SUMS(1) = SUMS(2) = 0
SUMS(3) = SUMS(4) = 1
