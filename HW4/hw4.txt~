Graph1 is not satisfiable with 3 colors from the RSat results.
However, Graph1 is satisfiable with 4 colors.

A possible solution is:

Node 1: Color 1 (R)
Node 2: Color 2 (G)
Node 3: Color 1 (R)
Node 4: Color 2 (G)
Node 5: Color 3 (B)
Node 6: Color 4 (Y)
Node 7: Color 3 (B)

For Graph2, the RSat is unsatisfiable with 1,2,...,7 colors. Therefore, a minimum of 8 colors are required to color the second graph.
